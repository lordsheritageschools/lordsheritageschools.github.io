You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <h2>welcome to Lord's heritage school</h2>
   <pr> 
   <img src="mum.jpg" width="102" height="106" /><p>We welcome you  to the website of our prestigious school, The site was created and launched so as to help develop the school in various areas as the internet is seen as an important tool today which helps the disssemination and propagation of information which you will love to know about the school. <br />
     we also developed a platform whereby every student has an account with the school and he is able to view his result and pay his school fees online.
     <br /> 
     At 
    Lord's heritage,we aim to create an ethos where every learner is   </p>

    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <p>Since this is a one-column layout, the .content is not floated. </p>
    <h3>Logo Replacement</h3>
    <p>An image placeholder was used in this layout in the .header where you'll likely want to place  a logo. It is recommended that you remove the placeholder and replace it with your own linked logo. </p>
    <p> Be aware that if you use the Property inspector to navigate to your logo image using the SRC field (instead of removing and replacing the placeholder), you should remove the inline background and display properties. These inline styles are only used to make the logo placeholder show up in browsers for demonstration purposes. </p>
    <p>To remove the inline styles, make sure your CSS Styles panel is set to Current. Select the image, and in the Properties pane of the CSS Styles panel, right click and delete the display and background properties. (Of course, you can always go directly into the code and delete the inline styles from the image or placeholder there.)</p>
